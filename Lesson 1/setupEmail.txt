Hey programming team!
 
It's time to start working on some robot code, and to do that first you have to set up your environment for FRC programming. Please follow these instructions and shoot me confirmation message once you're done.

1) Download VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)
2) Download Java SE Development Kit 11 (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html). WPILIb expects Java 11 on most systems. If you have a newer version of the Java SDK, either change your java home directory from the newer version to Java 11 or uninstall the new version. If you need help with this, please let me know.
3) Download the respective WPILib release. https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases. See the image attached to see what download you should be looking for.
4) Once you download the files from github, go to https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html. Go to your respective system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) and follow the instructions there. 
5) When you finish step 4, email me your github username so I can add you to the RoHawks github group. 
6) Download the latest github Desktop. https://desktop.github.com/. Install and sign into your github account.
7) Clone the files from https://github.com/RoHawks/BaseRobotCode onto your machine. VS Code has good support for Git so you can use their git clone command. If you are unfamiliar with git or VS Code's environment, email me when you are free so I can walk you through both downloading the code and making your own changes to it.

As always if you have any questions or problems feel free to let either Eric or me know.

Best,
Forrest
