# Lesson 6 - Compressors and Solenoids

- Compressors and Solenoids make up the pneumatics part of the robot, which take compressed air and use it to exert a large amount of work. 

## Compressors
- The compressors take in air around the robot and pressurizes it for use around the robot. 

## Solenoids
- The solenoid valves use voltage supplied to the pneumatics system to change the flow of air out of the compressors. 

## Uses!
- Shooting: Although we don't currently use pneumatics for shooting, using compressed air pistons can be a very effective way to shoot balls from our robot.
- Climbing: Because of the high force that pneumatics can exert, pneumatics works perfectly for raising the robot into the air and grappling onto the climbing stations.
