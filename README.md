# FRC Robotics Programming Education Materials

`Authored by Forrest Bicker & Eric Cao`

Advanced Java for Robotic Engineering: A Guide to FRC Programming. In this class you will use the WPILib Suite to learn how to connect code to hardware, including motors, pneumatics, sensors, and more! We will also cover practical technical skills including environment setup, logging, debugging, and firmware. Students are recommended to be familiar with basic programming fundamentals in any language, though prior experience is not required.

## Lesson 1 - Environment setup & WPI lib
Get your environment set up for work with the robot code and the materials we add to this github!

## Lesson 2 - User Input & Controls
Learn how to detect user input with the XboxController and use them to operate mechanisms

## Lesson 3 - Things that spin: Motors & Encoders
Check out the systems that control our motors and the ones that grab motor information for later use

## Lesson 4 - Things that spin: Servos & PID

## Lesson 5 - Gyroscopes & Limelights

## Lesson 6 - Compressors & Solenoids

## Lesson 7 - Logging & Debugging

## Lesson 8 - An exploration in swerve
